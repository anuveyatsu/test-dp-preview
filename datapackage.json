Two main series are provided: the Mauna Loa series (which has the longest continuous series since 1958) and a Global Average series (a global average over marine surface sites).\n\n## Data\n\n### Description\n\n> Data are reported as a dry air mole fraction defined as the number of molecules of carbon dioxide divided by the number of all molecules in air, including CO2 itself, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as parts per million (ppm). Example: 0.000400 is expressed as 400 ppm.[*][ccgg-trends]\n\n### Citations\n\n1. *Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide, Mauna Loa, Hawaii.* Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA/ESRL (www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/) and Dr. Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/).\n1. *Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide, Global.* Ed Dlugokencky and Pieter Tans, NOAA/ESRL (www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/).\n\n### Sources\n\n1. \n  * Name: Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide, Mauna Loa, Hawaii\n  * Web: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/index.html\n1. \n  * Name: Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide, Global\n  * Web: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html\n\n## Data Preparation\n\n### Processing\n\nRun the following script from this directory to download and process the data:\n\n```bash\nmake data\n```\n\n### Resources\n\nThe raw data are output to `./tmp`.
